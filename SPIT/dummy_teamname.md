# Project Name
Certification Using BlockChain
## Description
In this project we help the organization to issue their own blockchain on our network.The Blockchain Contains the Certicate issued by it to the User and the form of block.Before isssuing the certificate and giving it to the user ,the organization uploads the Certificate content in the form of hash in the Logs of the minner.The minner mines the certicate and provide the block address of the respecive certificate.The Certicate hardcopy along with the block address is provided to the user.
Whenever the user show his certificate to some other organization,for verfication the Org. can use the block address provided to it for finding the block of respective certificate andcopare the hash stored and the hash generated when the org provide the certificate to the website for verfication.
## Functions
In web3:
 Mine(): to mie the certicate in for of block on to the blockchain.
 verify(): to verify the certificate provided to the Organization .
Solidity():
  checker(): to the storedhash and the hash gnerated while the organization provide certificate to website for verification.

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed )

languages, frameworks, libraries etc. with their need & purpose
front-end:
 1.Html
 2.CSS
 3.Javascript
 
backend:
  1.Solidity
  2.nodejs
  3.web3
## Limitations
  Saclibity issue ,this idea is organization specific ,the blockchain will only belong to one Organization at time.And for multiple organization there will be multiple blockchains one for each organization.
## Future Aspects
 In future, we are aiming to convert the current system into a system that identifies new development in an individualâ€™s career  and register them into a ledger that will help to create digital resume. It will be using a verified Distributed Identity(DID) each time the individual shifts to a new organization which help reduce the effort needed to verify the documents again and again. Each time the individual joins a new company he will be provided with a new verified DID consisting of the employee certificate alongwith previously verified documents.
